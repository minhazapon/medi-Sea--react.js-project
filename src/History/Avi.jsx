By the age of 18, he had already mastered many disciplines, including mathematics and medicine. He practiced medicine throughout his life and served as a physician to various rulers and nobles.

Major Works: Avicenna's most famous work is "The Canon of Medicine" (Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb), a comprehensive medical encyclopedia that became a standard medical textbook in Europe and the Islamic world for centuries. The Canon synthesized medical knowledge from Greek, Roman, Persian, and Indian sources, organizing it into five books covering topics such as anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology.

Philosophical Contributions: In addition to his medical achievements, Avicenna made significant contributions to philosophy, particularly in metaphysics and epistemology.

In Europe, Latin translations of his works played a crucial role in the revival of classical learning during the Renaissance.

Death and Impact: Avicenna died in 1037 in Hamadan, Iran. Despite his death over a millennium ago, his legacy continues to be celebrated, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals in history. His contributions to medicine, philosophy, and science have left an indelible mark on human civilization.
